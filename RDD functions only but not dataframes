In PySpark, there are some functions that are specific to RDDs (Resilient Distributed Datasets) and do not work with DataFrames. RDDs are the fundamental building blocks of PySpark, and they provide a lower-level API compared to DataFrames, which offer higher-level, SQL-like abstractions. Below is a list of PySpark functions that work specifically for RDDs but are not applicable to DataFrames:

1. map()
RDD: Transforms each element of the RDD by applying a given function.
Not for DataFrames: DataFrames use select or withColumn for similar transformations.
python
Copy code
rdd = sc.parallelize([1, 2, 3, 4])
rdd.map(lambda x: x * 2).collect()  # [2, 4, 6, 8]
2. flatMap()
RDD: Similar to map(), but it allows returning multiple items for each element, flattening the result.
Not for DataFrames: There is no direct equivalent for this in DataFrames.
python
Copy code
rdd = sc.parallelize([1, 2, 3])
rdd.flatMap(lambda x: [x, x * 2]).collect()  # [1, 2, 2, 4, 3, 6]
3. reduce()
RDD: Aggregates the elements of the RDD using a function (e.g., sum).
Not for DataFrames: In DataFrames, you would use groupBy with aggregation functions (e.g., sum(), avg()).
python
Copy code
rdd = sc.parallelize([1, 2, 3, 4])
rdd.reduce(lambda x, y: x + y)  # 10
4. reduceByKey()
RDD: Aggregates values by key in key-value pairs.
Not for DataFrames: DataFrames use groupBy for similar key-based aggregations.
python
Copy code
rdd = sc.parallelize([("a", 1), ("b", 2), ("a", 3)])
rdd.reduceByKey(lambda x, y: x + y).collect()  # [('a', 4), ('b', 2)]
5. filter()
RDD: Filters elements of the RDD that satisfy a condition.
Not for DataFrames: DataFrames use the filter() or where() methods, but the DataFrame filter() is SQL-based and differs from RDD’s Python function-based filter.
python
Copy code
rdd = sc.parallelize([1, 2, 3, 4])
rdd.filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0).collect()  # [2, 4]
6. groupByKey()
RDD: Groups the values for each key in a key-value RDD.
Not for DataFrames: DataFrames use groupBy() for key-based operations, but they don’t have a direct equivalent to groupByKey() because it’s inefficient for large datasets.
python
Copy code
rdd = sc.parallelize([("a", 1), ("b", 2), ("a", 3)])
rdd.groupByKey().mapValues(list).collect()  # [('a', [1, 3]), ('b', [2])]
7. partitionBy()
RDD: Partitions the RDD by key using a specified number of partitions.
Not for DataFrames: DataFrames use repartition() or coalesce(), which are higher-level APIs that operate differently from partitionBy().
python
Copy code
rdd = sc.parallelize([("a", 1), ("b", 2), ("a", 3)])
rdd.partitionBy(2).glom().collect()
8. coalesce() (for RDDs)
RDD: Reduces the number of partitions in an RDD.
For DataFrames: The function coalesce() exists but behaves differently for RDDs and DataFrames. For RDDs, it simply changes the partitioning; for DataFrames, it merges partitions for optimization.
python
Copy code
rdd = sc.parallelize([1, 2, 3, 4], 4)
rdd.coalesce(2).getNumPartitions()  # 2
9. glom()
RDD: Converts each partition of the RDD into a list.
Not for DataFrames: There is no equivalent for this in DataFrames.
python
Copy code
rdd = sc.parallelize([1, 2, 3, 4], 2)
rdd.glom().collect()  # [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
10. keyBy()
RDD: Transforms an RDD into key-value pairs by applying a function to each element to extract the key.
Not for DataFrames: DataFrames do not work with key-value pairs in the same way.
python
Copy code
rdd = sc.parallelize([1, 2, 3])
rdd.keyBy(lambda x: x % 2).collect()  # [(1, 1), (0, 2), (1, 3)]
11. aggregate()
RDD: Similar to reduce(), but allows a more complex aggregation with an initial value and a combination of two functions.
Not for DataFrames: DataFrames do not have a direct equivalent; for DataFrames, you would typically use agg() in conjunction with groupBy().
python
Copy code
rdd = sc.parallelize([1, 2, 3, 4])
rdd.aggregate(0, (lambda x, y: x + y), (lambda x, y: x + y))  # 10
12. cartesian()
RDD: Produces the Cartesian product (cross product) of two RDDs.
Not for DataFrames: DataFrames do not have this function directly, though you can achieve a Cartesian product using SQL-like operations (crossJoin()).
python
Copy code
rdd1 = sc.parallelize([1, 2])
rdd2 = sc.parallelize([3, 4])
rdd1.cartesian(rdd2).collect()  # [(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)]
13. subtract()
RDD: Returns an RDD that contains the elements of the first RDD that are not in the second RDD.
Not for DataFrames: DataFrames have the exceptAll() function which performs a similar operation but follows SQL semantics.
python
Copy code
rdd1 = sc.parallelize([1, 2, 3])
rdd2 = sc.parallelize([2, 3, 4])
rdd1.subtract(rdd2).collect()  # [1]
14. intersection()
RDD: Returns an RDD that contains only the elements present in both RDDs.
Not for DataFrames: DataFrames have intersect() which performs a similar operation but is based on DataFrame columns and SQL-like behavior.
python
Copy code
rdd1 = sc.parallelize([1, 2, 3])
rdd2 = sc.parallelize([2, 3, 4])
rdd1.intersection(rdd2).collect()  # [2, 3]
15. sample()
RDD: Returns a sampled subset of an RDD.
For DataFrames: DataFrames also have a sample() method, but the behavior is slightly different due to how it is applied to distributed datasets.
python
Copy code
rdd = sc.parallelize([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
rdd.sample(False, 0.5).collect()  # Random subset

16. getNumPartitions()
# Repartition the DataFrame to a specific number of partitions
df_repartitioned = df.repartition(2)
num_partitions_repartitioned = df_repartitioned.rdd.getNumPartitions()
print(f"Number of partitions after repartitioning: {num_partitions_repartitioned}")

Summary:
The functions listed above are RDD-specific because RDDs offer lower-level, functional-style APIs, while DataFrames operate at a higher, declarative level with SQL-like operations. DataFrames are optimized for performance and provide a more structured approach to working with data, while RDDs are more flexible but less optimized for SQL-like operations.

If you're working on low-level transformations and need fine control over data processing, RDD functions can be powerful. However, for most high-level operations, especially those related to structured data, DataFrames are generally preferred due to their performance optimizations and ease of use.
