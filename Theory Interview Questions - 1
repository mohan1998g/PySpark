1. Designing an ETL Pipeline for Historical Customer Transaction Data on AWS
To build an ETL pipeline on AWS for processing a large historical dataset, consider the following design steps and AWS tools for each ETL stage.

ETL Pipeline Design:
Data Extraction:

AWS S3: Store raw historical data in S3 as the initial landing zone, benefiting from its scalability and durability.
AWS Glue: Use Glue Crawlers to automatically catalog the data in S3. Glue Crawlers can extract metadata from various data formats (CSV, JSON, Parquet) and store it in the Glue Data Catalog.
Data Transformation:

AWS Glue or AWS EMR: Use Glue for serverless transformations with Apache Spark if your transformations are relatively lightweight. For more complex transformations or large-scale data processing, consider AWS EMR to deploy a managed Spark or Hadoop cluster.
Apache Spark: Perform transformations such as filtering, aggregations, and joining with historical data, and output monthly reports.
Data Loading:

Amazon Redshift: Load the transformed data into Redshift for efficient querying and analysis.
Amazon Athena: If Redshift is not required, Athena can query data directly from S3 for an on-demand SQL interface.
Schema Evolution Handling:
Glue Data Catalog: Glue can manage schema evolution with its data catalog, which allows versioning. Schema changes can be detected and applied automatically if configured.
Partitioned Data on S3: For instance, partitioning data by year/month can help handle schema changes by applying them only to relevant partitions.
Data Quality Handling:
AWS Glue DataBrew: Use DataBrew for profiling data and applying data cleaning steps (e.g., handling null values, validating ranges, removing duplicates).
Data Validation Framework: Implement data validation in Glue scripts or PySpark jobs on EMR to check for data anomalies and consistency.
Performance and Cost Optimization:
Partitioning and File Format Optimization: Use partitioning (e.g., by date) and store data in columnar formats like Parquet to reduce storage costs and improve query speed.
Resource Scaling and Spot Instances: For EMR, configure auto-scaling to adapt to workload requirements. Use spot instances to reduce costs for non-critical parts of the pipeline.
Data Pruning and Caching: Only read necessary partitions or columns, and use caching for repeated transformations.
Redshift Spectrum or Athena for Querying: Redshift Spectrum or Athena allows querying S3 data directly, avoiding redundant data loading.
2. Designing a Data Model for Structured and Unstructured Data
To build an efficient data model that integrates structured and unstructured data, you need a hybrid approach that can handle both relational and JSON document data. Here’s a step-by-step approach:

Data Storage:

Structured Data (Relational Databases): Use Amazon RDS or Amazon Aurora for relational data that requires ACID transactions, indexes, and relational constraints.
Unstructured Data (JSON Documents): Use Amazon DynamoDB or Amazon DocumentDB to handle JSON data as they are NoSQL databases optimized for document storage.
Data Integration and Query Efficiency:

ETL Process: Extract unstructured data from DynamoDB and load it into Redshift or S3. Use AWS Glue or an ETL tool to periodically sync or combine data between sources.
Flatten JSON for Analysis: Use Glue to flatten and map JSON fields to a relational schema in Redshift, enabling SQL-based queries and aggregation.
Materialized Views: Use materialized views in Redshift for precomputed results from structured and unstructured sources to improve query performance.
Query Performance:

Redshift Spectrum: Query data in S3 (where transformed JSON data can be stored) from Redshift using Redshift Spectrum. This allows queries on both structured data in Redshift and unstructured JSON data in S3 without loading.
Indexed Queries in DynamoDB: For JSON data that stays in DynamoDB, use secondary indexes to optimize query performance on frequently queried attributes.
3. Configuring Secure Data Pipelines in AWS
To set up a secure data pipeline on AWS that transfers sensitive data, consider these security measures across IAM roles, encryption, and access control.

IAM Roles and Access Control:
Least Privilege IAM Roles: Use separate IAM roles for each AWS service, granting only necessary permissions (e.g., S3 read/write for Lambda, Redshift COPY permissions).
Cross-Service IAM Policies: Set up fine-grained policies that allow services (like Lambda) to access specific S3 buckets or Redshift tables based on business logic and data sensitivity.
Data Encryption:
Encryption at Rest:
S3: Enable S3 server-side encryption (SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS).
Redshift: Enable encryption for Redshift clusters using KMS keys.
Encryption in Transit: Use TLS for data transfer, ensuring that data between services (e.g., S3 to Redshift) is encrypted.
Access Control Mechanisms:
Bucket Policies for S3: Use S3 bucket policies to restrict access based on source IP or VPC endpoints, limiting access to approved origins.
Network Isolation with VPC: Place services in a VPC with restricted inbound/outbound access to ensure data is only accessible internally within AWS.
AWS Key Management Service (KMS): Use KMS to manage encryption keys with granular permissions and logging to control access to encrypted data.
4. Python Script to Calculate Total Sales for Each Product
Here's a Python script using pandas to load sales data, calculate total sales for each product, and save the result to a new CSV file:


import pandas as pd

# Load the sales data from CSV
df = pd.read_csv("sales_data.csv")

# Calculate total sales for each product
df['Total Sales'] = df['Quantity'] * df['Price']
total_sales = df.groupby('Product', as_index=False)['Total Sales'].sum()

# Save the result to a new CSV file
total_sales.to_csv("total_sales.csv", index=False)

print("Total sales data saved to total_sales.csv.")
Explanation:
Loading Data: pd.read_csv("sales_data.csv") reads the CSV into a DataFrame.
Calculating Total Sales: df['Total Sales'] = df['Quantity'] * df['Price'] computes the total sales for each row, and groupby('Product').sum() aggregates total sales by product.
Saving Output: to_csv("total_sales.csv", index=False) writes the results to a new CSV file without the index.


Wipro interview 

* Your one of source is S3 , what happen if one day you found that there is no data in the s3 , how will you overcome this ? Will you get any error? Do we have any prior plan for this ?

I will implement the code in such a way first we validate the whether I have today's Folder or not


import boto3
import botocore

s3 = boto3.resource('s3')

try:
    s3.Object('zeyodev', 'src/2024-11-10').load()
except botocore.exceptions.ClientError as e:
    if e.response['Error']['Code'] == "404":
        # The object does not exist.
        {PUT LOGIC IF THAT DOES NOT EXIST}
    else:
        # Something else has gone wrong.
        raise
else:
    # The object does exist.




* From where you were getting the wep api data?


For our customers we have developed a Customer portal(mobile app,webapp) when ever they make an entry -- JAVA API produce the data which we would consume

We have an upstream java team who take care of pushing the customer api data



* If you have Table in Hive and everyday you fetch data from hive using spark,  but today you do not want that data from hive table having employee ID > 1000.How Will you do that?


We can maintain a config file in Production. We have to implement in such a way that if i have  config file then hive would first read that config file with content inside it (1000) and apply the filter

If the config does not exist at all -- its a normal process


* From hive suddenly a column get updated ( new column added). How will you fix this ?


If its avro.. its easy . Maintaining AVSC file(ADD COLUMN)

If its not avro --- if its external table -- Drop and re create

If its not avro and not external table --- IMPOSSIBLE


* Integration of hive with Spark write the code.


df.write.saveAsTable("db.table")


* saveAsTable vs save

saveAsTable -- to write to hive table
save -- to write to file system


* After that all about deployment .
