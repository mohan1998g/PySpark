4. Spark Production Issues

4.1. Spark Job Failures

Description: Spark jobs may fail due to resource exhaustion, driver failures, or data skew.

Possible Causes:

Insufficient driver or executor memory.

Data skew leading to unbalanced task distribution.

Incorrect Spark configurations.


Solutions:

Increase executor memory (spark.executor.memory) and driver memory (spark.driver.memory).

Use salting or skew join optimization to balance data distribution.

Validate and optimize Spark configurations based on workload requirements.



4.2. Slow Spark Jobs

Description: Spark jobs may take longer than expected, affecting job throughput.

Possible Causes:

Large shuffles due to wide transformations.

Inadequate parallelism.

Unoptimized serialization.


Solutions:

Use caching (cache()) to avoid recomputation of frequently accessed data.

Increase the number of partitions using repartition() or coalesce() for better parallelism.

Switch to Kryo serialization for improved performance (spark.serializer).



4.3. Driver Failure or Crash

Description: The Spark driver may crash, leading to job termination.

Possible Causes:

Excessive memory usage on the driver.

Complex query plans executed on the driver.


Solutions:

Increase driver memory (spark.driver.memory).

Offload large transformations to executors instead of running them on the driver.

Implement checkpointing to recover from partial job failures.



4.4. Executor Memory Leaks

Description: Memory leaks within executors can lead to frequent garbage collection or OutOfMemory errors.

Possible Causes:

Inefficient code causing objects to persist longer than necessary.

Improper handling of broadcast variables.


Solutions:

Profile and optimize Spark application code to manage memory usage effectively.

Use broadcast variables judiciously and clean them up when no longer needed.

Monitor executor memory usage and adjust configurations accordingly.



4.5. Task Failures and Retries

Description: High number of task failures and retries can degrade job performance.

Possible Causes:

Data corruption or inconsistencies.

Resource contention or insufficient allocation.


Solutions:

Investigate and fix underlying data issues causing task failures.

Allocate sufficient resources to prevent contention.

Tune Spark retry configurations (spark.task.maxFailures).



4.6. Shuffle and Spill Issues

Description: Excessive shuffling and spilling to disk can slow down Spark jobs.

Possible Causes:

Large shuffle operations due to wide transformations.

Inadequate memory allocated for shuffle buffers.


Solutions:

Optimize Spark jobs to minimize shuffle operations.

Increase shuffle buffer sizes (spark.shuffle.memoryFraction).

Use Tungsten for efficient in-memory computation.



4.7. Job Scheduling Delays

Description: Delays in job scheduling can increase overall job execution time.

Possible Causes:

High cluster utilization leading to resource scarcity.

Inefficient scheduling policies.


Solutions:

Implement fair or capacity scheduling to balance resource allocation.

Optimize job submission strategies to prevent resource starvation.

Scale the cluster to handle increased workloads.



4.8. Data Serialization Issues

Description: Inefficient data serialization can lead to increased latency and memory usage.

Possible Causes:

Use of default Java serialization which is slower and bulkier.

Serialization of complex or nested objects.


Solutions:

Switch to Kryo serialization (spark.serializer=org.apache.spark.serializer.KryoSerializer) for better performance.

Register custom serializers for complex objects to optimize serialization.



4.9. Integration with External Systems

Description: Issues integrating Spark with external systems like databases, message queues, or storage systems.

Possible Causes:

Incompatible connector versions.

Network or authentication issues.


Solutions:

Ensure compatibility between Spark and external system connectors.

Configure network and authentication settings correctly.

Test integrations in a controlled environment before production deployment.



4.10. Handling Large Data Volumes

Description: Managing and processing very large datasets can strain Spark resources.

Possible Causes:

Insufficient cluster resources.

Inefficient data partitioning and storage formats.


Solutions:

Scale the Spark cluster horizontally to provide additional resources.

Optimize data storage using columnar formats like Parquet or ORC.

Implement data partitioning and bucketing to enhance parallelism and reduce data shuffling.

5. General Best Practices

Monitoring: Set up robust monitoring and alerting systems using tools like Grafana, Prometheus, Ambari, or Cloudera Manager to detect and address issues promptly.

Logging: Configure detailed logging for each component (e.g., Log4j for Hadoop, Spark UI for Spark) to facilitate troubleshooting and root cause analysis.

Resource Management: Optimize resource management through YARN configurations, resource quotas, and scheduler settings to ensure fair and efficient resource allocation.

Data Validation: Implement data validation techniques such as checksums, row counts, and schema validation to ensure data accuracy during and after transfers.

Security: Enforce strong security practices, including encryption, authentication, and authorization, to protect data integrity and privacy.

Scalability: Design the architecture to scale horizontally, allowing the cluster to handle increasing workloads without significant performance degradation.

Automation: Automate deployment, scaling, and recovery processes using tools like Ansible, Terraform, or Kubernetes to enhance reliability and reduce manual intervention.

Documentation: Maintain comprehensive documentation for configurations, processes, and troubleshooting steps to facilitate knowledge sharing and efficient issue resolution.

Regular Updates and Patching: Keep all components up-to-date with the latest patches and updates to benefit from performance improvements, new features, and security fixes.

Testing: Conduct thorough testing in staging environments before deploying changes to production to identify and mitigate potential issues proactively.

CDPD-60862: Rolling restart fails during ZDU when DDL operations are in progress
During a Zero Downtime Upgrade (ZDU), the rolling restart of services that support Data Definition Language (DDL) statements might fail if DDL operations are in progress during the upgrade. As a result, ensure that you do not run DDL statements during ZDU.

The following services support DDL statements:
Impala
Hive – using HiveQL
Spark – using SparkSQL
HBase
Phoenix
Kafka
Data Manipulation Lanaguage (DML) statements are not impacted and can be used during ZDU. Following the successful upgrade, you can resume running DDL statements.

None. Cloudera recommends modifying applications to not use DDL statements for the duration of the upgrade. If the upgrade is already in progress, and you have experienced a service failure, you can remove the DDLs in-flight and resume the upgrade from the point of failure.
CDPD-67517: Spark3 tests are failing if /tmp is mounted as noexec.
Map the tmpdir to a writable path in spark3-conf/spark-defaults.conf using the following steps:
In the Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) Management Console, go to Data Hub Clusters.
Find and select the cluster you want to configure.
Click the link for the Cloudera Manager URL.
Go to the Spark service.
Click the Configuration tab.
Select Scope > Gateway.
Select Category > Advanced.
Locate the Spark Client Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for spark3-conf/spark-defaults.conf_client_config_safety_valve property.
Map the tmpdir to a writable path:
spark.driver.extraJavaOptions=-Djava.io.tmpdir=/var/tmp
spark.executor.extraJavaOptions=-Djava.io.tmpdir=/var/tmp
Enter a Reason for change, and then click Save Changes to commit the changes.
Deploy the client configuration.
CDPD-23817: In the upgraded Cluster, the permission of /tmp/spark is restricted due to the HDP configuration hive.exec.scratchdir=/tmp/spark.
If you are using the /tmp/spark directory in the CDP cluster, you must provide the required additional Policies/ACL permissions.
CDPD-22670 and CDPD-23103: There are two configurations in Spark, "Atlas dependency" and "spark_lineage_enabled", which are conflicted. The issue is when Atlas dependency is turned off but spark_lineage_enabled is turned on.
Run Spark application, Spark will log some error message and cannot continue. That can be restored by correcting the configurations and restarting Spark component with distributing client configurations.
CDPD-23007: Mismatch in the Spark Default DB Location. In HDP 3.1.5, hive_db entities have one attribute - 'location' which is configured to the '/managed' path. In fresh install of CDP 7.1.7, hive_db entities now have 2 attributes 'location' configured to '/external' path and 'managedLocation' configured to '/managed' path. In. the AM2CM migration (HDP 3.1.5 -> CDP 7.1.7), the 'location' attribute from hive_db entities in HDP 3.1.5 comes unaltered to CDP 7.1.7 and hence maps to '/managed' path.
This issue arises only if you are upgrading from HDP 3.1.5 to CDP 7.1.7. If you are performing a fresh install of CDP 7.1.7, you can ignore this issue.
None
CDPD-217: The Apache Spark connector is not supported
The old Apache Spark - Apache HBase Connector (shc) is not supported in CDP releases.
Use the new HBase-Spark connector shipped in CDP release.
CDPD-3038: Launching pyspark displays several HiveConf warning messages
When pyspark starts, several Hive configuration warning messages are displayed, similar to the following:
23/08/02 08:37:26 WARN conf.HiveConf: HiveConf of name hive.metastore.runworker.in does not exist
23/08/02 08:37:26 WARN conf.HiveConf: HiveConf of name hive.masking.algo does not exist
23/08/02 08:37:34 WARN conf.HiveConf: HiveConf of name hive.metastore.runworker.in does not exist
23/08/02 08:37:34 WARN conf.HiveConf: HiveConf of name hive.masking.algo does not exist
