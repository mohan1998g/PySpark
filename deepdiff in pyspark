Using the DeepDiff library in PySpark can help you compare complex nested data structures, such as JSON objects, to identify differences. However, PySpark does not natively support DeepDiff, so you will need to integrate it into your PySpark workflows via UDFs (User Defined Functions).

Here's how to do it:

Steps to Use DeepDiff in PySpark:
Install DeepDiff: Ensure that the DeepDiff library is installed in your environment.
Use a UDF to apply DeepDiff on the nested structures within Spark DataFrames.
1. Install DeepDiff
If you haven't installed DeepDiff yet, you can install it using:

bash
Copy code
pip install deepdiff
2. Using DeepDiff in PySpark
Once DeepDiff is installed, we can write a Python function that utilizes DeepDiff and wrap it in a PySpark UDF (User Defined Function) to apply it to DataFrames.

Let's assume we have a Spark DataFrame with JSON-like nested structures in one of the columns. We can use DeepDiff to compare two such structures.

Example Workflow
Here's an example of how to use DeepDiff with PySpark:

Sample DataFrame
python
Copy code
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.functions import col
from pyspark.sql.types import StringType

# Initialize Spark session
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("DeepDiffExample").getOrCreate()

# Sample data with JSON-like structures
data = [
    (1, '{"name":"zeyo","Students":["rajesh","vishnu"]}', '{"name":"zeyo","Students":["rajesh","gowtham"]}'),
    (2, '{"name":"rani","Students":["vijay","hema"]}', '{"name":"rani","Students":["vijay","hema"]}'),
    (3, '{"name":"vasi","Students":["harika","gowtham"]}', '{"name":"vasi","Students":["harika"]}')
]

# Create DataFrame
df = spark.createDataFrame(data, ["ID", "json1", "json2"])

# Show the DataFrame
df.show(truncate=False)
This DataFrame df contains two columns (json1 and json2) with JSON-like string structures.

Example Data:
lua
Copy code
+---+---------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+
|ID |json1                                        |json2                                        |
+---+---------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+
|1  |{"name":"zeyo","Students":["rajesh","vishnu"]}|{"name":"zeyo","Students":["rajesh","gowtham"]}|
|2  |{"name":"rani","Students":["vijay","hema"]}  |{"name":"rani","Students":["vijay","hema"]}  |
|3  |{"name":"vasi","Students":["harika","gowtham"]}|{"name":"vasi","Students":["harika"]}        |
+---+---------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+
Define a UDF Using DeepDiff
We will define a UDF (User Defined Function) in PySpark that uses DeepDiff to compare the json1 and json2 columns.

python
Copy code
from pyspark.sql.functions import udf
from deepdiff import DeepDiff
import json

# Define a UDF to apply DeepDiff
def deep_diff(json1_str, json2_str):
    try:
        # Parse the JSON strings
        json1 = json.loads(json1_str)
        json2 = json.loads(json2_str)
        
        # Use DeepDiff to compare
        diff = DeepDiff(json1, json2)
        return str(diff)
    except Exception as e:
        return str(e)

# Register the UDF
deep_diff_udf = udf(deep_diff, StringType())

# Apply the UDF to compare 'json1' and 'json2'
df_with_diff = df.withColumn("diff", deep_diff_udf(col("json1"), col("json2")))

# Show the results
df_with_diff.select("ID", "diff").show(truncate=False)
Output:
css
Copy code
+---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|ID |diff                                                                                    |
+---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|1  |{'values_changed': {"root['Students'][1]": {'new_value': 'gowtham', 'old_value': 'vishnu'}}}|
|2  |{}                                                                                     |
|3  |{'iterable_item_removed': {"root['Students'][1]": 'gowtham'}}                           |
+---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
Explanation:
ID 1: There is a value change between the two JSON objects in the Students array (vishnu was changed to gowtham).
ID 2: The two JSON objects are identical, so the diff is empty.
ID 3: One student (gowtham) was removed from the Students array.
Summary of the Approach:
Install DeepDiff to handle complex nested comparisons.
Create a UDF that parses JSON and applies DeepDiff.
Apply the UDF to DataFrames with JSON structures to compute differences.
This process allows you to compare complex JSON objects (or any nested structures) inside PySpark DataFrames using DeepDiff.
