When the entire data is a long string such as

data = "A-24-TV-B-25-FRIDGE-C-26-AC-D-40-FAN"

Here the data is repeating, so we need to seperate as rows

The regex for this is

        .*?\\| = .*?\|
        .*?\\- = .*?\-

The last character in aboue regex is based on the string

\ ----> is used in regex tools
\\ ---> is ised in string literals and languages

$0- or $0, -----  $0  -->  represents the entire string that matches the regex. When we give this, we are appending - or , to the matched string, without replacing it

If we give only - or, without $0, entire string will be deleted

replacedf = df.withColumn("new", regexp_replace("value", '(.*?\\-){n})', "$0,"))

explodedf = replacedf.withColumn("explode", explode(split(replacedf.new, '-,')))

splitdf = explodedf.withColumn("col name", split(explodedf.explode, '-')[0])

# write the with column for as many columns required
